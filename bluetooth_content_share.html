Don’t use any external styling library, all styling should be done natively. <br><br>Pick a good file structure, determing your naming conventions, follow good separations of concern, code reusability, consistent design. I’ll advice you don’t use AI or code generation to do this, i want to see your thought pattern and see how to align you, so put your best natural self. <br><br>Submission:<br>- Send a link to the publicly available github repo, the repo should be named ‘tech-chantier-warmup1-auth-flow’<br>- ⁠Do a video, max 10 minutes recording your screen, explaining your code from the start to finish, explain all the things considered and why you used anything you used. That video should be uploaded to your youtube channel, marked as unlisted and you send me the link. <br><br>Both links should be sent here to my whatsapp, on or before Wednesday 9AM so i have enough time to review, give feedback. <br><br>PS: The forms should be validated, for this exercise, don’t use any external validator, you should manually code the validator. <br><br>Upon form submission, on the same page, show me a modal that will show all the information that i filled up and 2 buttons <br>- BTN1 : Close - that just closes modal<br>- ⁠BTN2: Close and clear - that closes the modal and clears the form.<br></body></html>
